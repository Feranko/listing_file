for windows you simply run the .exe file, and it open a terminal panel that display the current file and folder in the directory, 
or if you want to run in the terminal directly you can  add a path to that.

for linux I suggest you to move from "file" to "fi"
  because file is an internal comand
  so now use the "chmod +x" omand to make it runable
  in the end you should put it in the /usr/bin/ folder
